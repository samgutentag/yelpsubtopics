# Extracting Sub Topic Ratings from Yelp Review Text
This project leverages Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) from the `gensim` library  to extract topics from the 496,000 Yelp Reviews given to 7066 Restaurants in the State of Arizona.

# Results


# Reproduce my Work
Few simple steps to get started and reproduce my work.

## Getting Started
Clone this repo to get started.  From there, if you are using `conda` to manage your virtual environment, run the following command to setup the environment and install the needed packages.  Be sure to pass the included `environment.yml` file.

```
# conda env create environment.yml
```

## Prerequisites
There are a few steps involved in getting `nltk` and `spacy`  up and running.

Run the following commands from the command line to install the NLTK and spaCy package resources needed.  For more documentation on spaCy, follow [this link](https://spacy.io/usage/)

```
# python -m nltk.downloader all
# python -m spacy download en
```

Lastly, the data used for this project is supplied by the [Yelp Open Dataset](https://www.yelp.com/dataset).  You will need to download a copy of the source data and store it in a directory called `source_data` to run these notebooks without making changes to any code.

Specifically, you will need to copy over `business.json` and `review.json` from the downloaded data set to the `source_data` directory.

The starter directory structure should look like this:

```
yelpsubtopics
| -README.md
| -environment.yml
| -.gitignore
| -models
| -clean_data
| -source_data
|   |- business.json
|   |- review.json
| -documents
| -DataWrangling
|   |- 00_Business_Data_Wrangling.ipynb
|   |- 01_Review_Wrangling.ipynb
| -TopicModelling
|   |- model_03a_all_reviews_nouns.ipynb
|   |- model_05_all_reviews.ipynb
|   |- model_02_nff_reviews.ipynb
|   |- MODEL_SUMMARY.ipynb
|   |- model_01_ff_reviews.ipynb
|   |- model_04_all_reviews_nouns_verbs.ipynb
| -SubTopicReviews
|   |- SubTopicTagging_Model5.ipynb
|   |- SubTopic_Investigation.ipynb
|   |- plottingtools
|       |- init__.py
| -scripts
|   |- clean_checkins.py
|   |- clean_users.py
| -charts
|   |- reports
```

## Order of Operations
To successfully reproduce my results, run the notebooks in the following order:

1. DataWrangling/00_Business_Data_Wrangling.ipynb
2. DataWrangling/01_Review_Wrangling.ipynb
3. TopicModelling/model_05_all_reviews.ipynb
4. SubTopicReviews/SubTopicTagging_Model5.ipynb
5. SubTopicReviews/SubTopic_Investigation.ipynb

There are several additional notebooks in the `TopicModelling` directory that can be run and include additional output lda models.  The final results of this project use the model generated by the `model_05_all_reviews.ipynb` notebook.
